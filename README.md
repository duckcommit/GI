# GI Tract Image Segmentation Flutter App

First of all, shout out to @Arlendious for providing the ML model.

The GI Tract Image Segmentation Flutter App is a medical application designed to assist healthcare professionals in segmenting MRI scans of the gastrointestinal tract. This automated tool uses machine learning to identify areas that require surgical intervention, ensuring a more efficient and precise approach to cancer treatment.

# Key Features

User Authentication: Healthcare professionals can sign up and log in using their organization email addresses, which are hardcoded for security. Email verification is implemented via OTP.

Dashboard: Users have access to a user-friendly dashboard where they can upload MRI scans for segmentation.

Automated Image Segmentation: The app uses a machine learning model to automatically segment MRI scans and identify areas that require surgical attention.

Secure Data Storage: All segmented images are securely stored in phone storage for future reference.

# Tech Stack

Flutter: A popular open-source framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
